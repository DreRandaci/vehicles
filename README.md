# vehicles

### Instructions for Assigment:
- Use your knowledge of the Interface Segregation Principle and the Dependency Inversion Principle to convert the template code into a system that is more flexible and extensible to accomodate any kind of vehicle class. Each class should only implement code that it needs.
- Create at least two types of each vehicle (water based, ground based, and air based).
- Complete the tasks in the comments of the `Main()` method.
